Modelling
 - Do not use fractional change for inflation since it's already % increase. Make sure everything is bounded between the same values.
 - Show best features for the HMM.
 - Remove datasets that have no correlation and run model again.
 - Correlation is showing pure linearity.
 - HMM could do as well as the LSTM but HMM is difficult to scale. When there are a lot of nodes it's like a neural network without gradient descent which is expensive and hard to run.
 - Plot graphs and show how important the features are. Remove features we think are important and show the forecast error.
 - Make sure there is no double counting in the LSTM model.

Report
 - Data collection and reasoning.
 - Feature identification and description of important features.
 - Increase complexity of models gradually.
 - OHLC with Black Swan events.
 - Use S&P to show the 2008 recession and other indexes to support the argument that this was not the only feature affected.
