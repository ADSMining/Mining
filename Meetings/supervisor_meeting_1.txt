Look at more Bloomberg data if necessary. Might be worth going in an looking at the largest cost and largest revenues. Large companies need energy/oil so the energy/oil prices might affect it
Plotly has ohlc library https://plotly.com/python/ohlc-charts/
Some of the data given is useless. Comparing covariance is one way to check which data is important (like F3METL vs SPX500)
Work out what components to put into the ML model. It is a Data Science unit not an ML unit so do not focus too much on this.
News headlines of important events. Might be difficult without NLP knowledge. Maybe just mark interesting changes if they correlate with important events.
Consider performing PCA.
Objective is to write a common OHLC function for Bloomberg data that takes a .csv file and plots visualisations.
Refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09363.pdf. We could zoom in and zoom out graphs like on Page 22.
Refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04110.pdf for plotting time series data.
We could leave missing data as NaN or fill it with 0. 
We could pad data using Pandas.
We can an ignore general earning index in F3METL
