Normalise the prices. Take the percentage change of the prices instead of the raw data.
Look at covariance for seasonal time periods. Analyse features for each window to remove seasonal patterns like rise/fall during Christmas. Change the window size and look at the correlation.
Make use of t-tests to ensure that the data chosen is correct.
P value for significance.

Report
The report should principally be on feature identification. Use covariance, regression, and PCA to justify your choices and different sliding window sizes to analyse the performance.
Write about Black Swan events like 2008, COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices, and the Ukraine invasion when visualising the trends.
Mention that you can even forecast using the models.
Mention why we didn't include operating costs in the report. Also mention that we need a lot more data to create a good forecasting model.
Write about future work and ongoing research in the report.

LSTMs
Batch size can't be too high. Just make it so that it doesn't run out of memory.
Set epoch to 100 or so.

PCA
Percentage difference and then normalise them to bound it between 0 and 1.
Use the standard normaliser in scikit learn.
