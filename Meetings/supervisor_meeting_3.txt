Build a model to show how these factors impact the earnings.
State your hypothesis in the report.
Decide what the most important piece of data is based on your results.
Does one factor impact one company more than the others.
Use PCA to compare the importance of the characteristics.
Use Auto regressive models (ARMA) for time series data.
Regression problem: Indicator value (x) vs Actual earnings (y)
Could estimate the variance of the price.
Could use RNN and LSTMs.
Could make decision trees for each of the companies the company buys from and run Random Forests.
Reference the original ML algorithm. Don't go into too much detail. Explain the limitations of the model if there are any.
Justify your feature choices using previous work and earnings reports.
Calculate the covariance and p-value to check if the results are significant.
We will have online meetings during Easter.
